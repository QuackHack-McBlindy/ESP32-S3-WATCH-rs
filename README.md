## **ESP32-S3-WATCH**

> [!NOTE]
> **🧑‍🦯 Personal project!**  
> **As I am blind this OS is mostly focused on accessibility through the voice assistant functionality of the watch.**  
> **It has a full graphical user interface -- but it's designed for a blind man, so it's BIG.**  
<br>


**Bare Metal** *(no-std)* voice-driven wearable OS for **ESP32-S3** smartwatch with a high focus on accessibility and smart home and media control. Written in Rust, using `esp-hal` as it's hardware abstraction layer.  
There is no usage of the `ESP-IDF` API in this firmware.   
  
Designed to be used as a personal voice assistant watch with **EXTENSIVE** custom voice commands & **much much more!** *(I flush the toilet with this thing..)*  

*“Source code is the best documentation.“*   

<br>
Be sure to check out the demo usage videos/pictures down below.  
<br>

Its up to [yo](https://github.com/QuackHack-McBlindy/yo) to write your own voice commands.  
My watch can execute **57** different [scripts](https://github.com/QuackHack-McBlindy/dotfiles), and understands **272684913**  different phrases as voice commands **-- with a average processing time of 2,72 ms per command**.  
  
The top-tier performance come from a **deterministic** voice architecture and smart caching inside the voice intents.

**Sorry, I have been told I am the master of blurry pictures.**  
*(how would I know...)*  

There is a video demo from the web-based Qwackify too down below.  

<br>


## **Overview**


*“A powerful voice assistant can make a huge difference for blind people.”*  
*“Imagine yourself stumbling blindly across the room looking for the remote — meanwhile, I cam call it using only my voice.”*  


`ESP32-S3-WATCH-rs` is a `no_std` Rust firmware for the ESP32-S3 based smartwatch. The primary goal is to create a fully voice‑controlled assistant that is highly accessible for blind and visually impaired users. All interactions can be performed via voice, and the graphical interface is designed with large, high‑contrast elements.  

The watch streams audio to a companion backend service called [`yo`](https://github.com/QuackHack-McBlindy/yo), which handles wake word detection, speech‑to‑text, intent recognition and execution, and text‑to‑speech synthesis. The watch itself streams microphone audio, serves TCP server for audio streaming to the speaker, manages notifications, plays media, and serves a web frontend for web based media playback in the browser called **Qwackify**, which is like Jellyfin on steroids - but much more good looking and served directly from a watch.  <br>

The watch also has an internal API serving GET endpoints for controlling options and media playback -- playing local music straight from the micro SD card is as easy as:  <br>
**From your desktop:** `curl http://<ESP_IP>/api/media/search/songs/mysong`.  <br>
**From the watch:** tap the boot button to open the app launcher, swipe down to the app `Qwackify` and double tap it to open then press play.  <br>
**Using your voice, say:** `yo bitch! play the duck song`.  

<br>

## **Project Structure & Design**  

I knew that if I did not do this properly like I want it - right away, that it would get really messy, and never get done.  
I amm basically writing a complete voice-driven API on top of every available run-time option of `esp-hal`.   
Modular API and using use statements only when needed, otherwise fully qualified paths everywhere, should help keep things as tiny as possible.      
I also prefer to have some of the extensive code as library crates, it can be useful for other people or simplify usage for myself on my other devices.

## **Roadmap**


Project roadmap - watch as `watch` grows and evolves along the road.  
Extend with more crazy ideas as they pop up. `ESP32-S3-WATCH-rs` is still under active development, and will be as long as this list is not complete.  
**Feel free to contribute with any cool ideas you might have for the `ESP32-S3`! - Nothing is impossible!**  

- [x] Async & WiFi
- [x] Handle multiple SSID/WiFi alternatives  
- [x] Buttons & Deep Sleep (power-save mode)
- [x] Interactive Shell terminal (Bash syntax over HTTP)
- [x] Remote file upload to the SD card (streamed chunks, POST)
- [x] Remote file download from the SD card (streamed chunks)
- [x] i2s: RX Microphone  
- [x] i2s: TX Speaker  
- [x] i2s: Simultaneous RX & TX  (Full-Duplex)
- [x] Voice Command Execution (Wake word, speech to shell command)
- [x] Push-to-talk feature (more battery effecient)
- [x] Media Player - Stream any audio to speaker (wav, mp3, flac, mp4, ...)
- [x] Fuzzy search & play local media from the SD card. (with downsampling) 
- [x] Intercom `ffmpeg -f alsa -i default -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 2 - | nc <ESP_IP> 12345`
- [x] On-Device API
- [x] On-Device WebServer & Web Media Player (with casting to Android TV)
- [x] Control & start/pause any task from the GUI 
- [ ] Draw graphs on watch from input data 
- [ ] Generate on-device QR codes. (need TLS for secure secret sharing via QR)
- [x] Broadcasting all text-to-speech to every ESP32 device.   
- [ ] tinyWeather app - (GeoByIP, one icon - no token)
- [ ] Phone calls/text message (Bluetooth HandsFree Protocol)
- [ ] Remember settings changes between boots/firmware updates
- [x] Backend: `yo`

`yo` is not only the backend server service but it's also where you will write your voice commands.  
This is where your `ESP32-S3` microphone audio will be streamed.   

- [yo](https://github.com/QuackHack-McBlindy/yo)  
  - Wake Word Detection
  - Speech To Text
  - Text To Speech
  - Voice Command Execution
  - Control any device option with your voice!

## **Usage**


### **Frontend**  

If you prefer to handle your media manually in the web browser - good news!  
Your `ESP32-S3` is now serving a fully featured media player that can cast to your TV's and has built-in transcoding (transcoding on backend).  
You can go ahead and visit your device at:  

`http://<ESP_IP>/`

### **Shell**

A Bash‑like interactive shell over HTTP.  
Commands are issued via `GET /api/shell/{command}`.  
Spaces must be encoded as `%20`, and slashes inside paths as `%2F`.  

**Examples:**  

```bash
# `ls /Music`
curl "http://<ESP_IP>/api/shell/ls%20%2FMusic"
```

Or check what is on the SD card from browser, visit: `http://<ESP_IP>/api/shell/tree`  
You should see something like:  

```
📂 .
├── 📂 Music
│   ├── 🎵 ducksong-1.mp3  
│   └── 🎵 ducksong-gangstarap.mp3
└── 📂 share
    └──  image.jpeg
```


| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `--help` or `help` | Print shell documentation and examples |
| `ls [path]` | List directory contents (relative or absolute) |
| `cd [path]` | Change working directory (`.` = stay, `..` = up one, `...` = up two, no arg = root) |
| `pwd` | Print current working directory |
| `nano <file>` | Creates a text file (TODO) |
| `cat <file>` | Display text file content |
| `hexdump <file>` | Show binary file in hexadecimal (truncated to ~500 chars) |
| `rm <file>` | Delete a file (no confirmation) |
| `mv <file> <path>` | Moves a file **Note: moving of very large is not possible** |
| `jq <file>` | Parse JSON file (TODO) |
| `tree [path]` | Recursive directory listing |



> **Persistence:** The shell keeps state – `cd` into a directory, then `ls` and `cat` will use that directory for relative paths.  
> Use `pwd` to see where you are.  


<br>



### **Media Player** 


> [!NOTE]
> __🎵 Media Player__ <br>
> **Media player supports any file format, and can play any file or playlist.**  
> **You can use the provided `scripts/play-esp.sh` helper script to stream audioo to the device speaker.**
<br>

## **Voice Assistant**

Wake word detection is disabled by default to save battery.  
Hold the `BOOT` button to send voice commands, release it when done talking.   

### **Architecture**

Check out the official [yo repository](https://github.com/QuackHack-Mcblindy/yo).  

<br>

The **yo** voice assistant employs a dual-language architecture that separates grammar compilation from runtime interpretation.  
This design allows for a **rapid** fast, deterministic, and privacy-first offline-capable system.  
  
The architecture is fundamentally split into two parts:  

- **Compile-Time (Nix):** Acts as a grammar compiler. It takes declarative sentence templates from configuration files, expands them into all possible variants, and pre-compiles them into optimized regular expressions.  

- **Runtime (Rust):** Functions as a deterministic interpreter. It takes audio input, matches it against the pre-compiled patterns, extracts any defined parameters, and executes the corresponding script with those arguments.  

<br>

So - no more bad, expensive strategies like:  

> * speech ➤ LLM ➤ guess intent  

Instead the flow looks like:   

> * speech ➤ deterministic intent match ➤ script  

<br>

**Result:** Designed for speeed and safety. All heavy lifting is done at build-time.   

<br>


### **My Voice Commands**

<!-- MY_VOICE_COMMANDS_START -->

My voice assistant can currently execute **57** voice scripts.   
That is **2503** regex patterns and makes a total of **272684913** understandable phrases available as voice commands.

### **Peripherals**

#### **I2S**

I2S is used as single peripheral.  
**I2S TX** is configured as Master, while **I2S RX** is set to slave mode.  
Audio codecs (ES7210/ES8311) are configured via I2C, and are used as slaves.   

<br>

<br>

## **Graphical User Interface**

You boot up at the clock page.  
Swiping down from the very top of the screen slides down the control center which has 4 quick access button slots.  
Swipe left to get to the app launcher, which has 1x1 big icons that smoothly scrolls like a list.  
Tapping an app does nothing (to prevent accidental openings).  
Double tap will open the application.  
A upwards swipe gesture from the very bottom will close the open application and send user back to homescreen (clock page).  
  

Going right from the clock page will show the battery page which has a clean looking ARC gauge with an bolt when charging.   

To the right of the battery page we have **tinyWeather** which shows temperature and a big weather icon.     

Inside the **Qwackify** (media player) application clicking the Qwackify icon will split the view into two pieces that slide apart and show the playlist.  
The trashcan will clear the temporary playlist without confirmation.  
CLicking the heart icon will save current song to your favourite playlist.  

<br>


## **Applications**  

**Settings** - From the settings application user can control all settings at runtime using toggle switch buttons in the GUI and/or swipe gestures, like speaker volume swipe up/down for example.  
All the embassy-executor tasks can also be started/paused from this application.  


**Qwackify** - a media player with play/pause & previous/next track buttons, title & progress bar.  
  
**House** - Smart Home application with some quick action buttons etc, most of the home control is done by voice anyway.  

**tinyWeather** - More of a widget than an app really. Displays the current temperature and an icon representing current weather state on the display. Only updates when manually clicked.
  
Will extend with more applications as I think of any useful ones.  

<br>


## **Power Management & Optimizations**  

User control all tasks/peripherals from the GUI, and therefore handle their own optimizations.
